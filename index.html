					<h2>About Me</h2> 
					<p>Hi, my name is Shan Jhaveri. I am from a town called Longhill, in New Jersey, but I was born in New York. I still live in New Jersey, though I do not want to live there anymore. My family consists of my brother, mom, and dad. Something interesting about me is that since I was born, I have been allergic to almost everything on the planet. When I was a baby, I was only able to eat rice and bananas. Thankfully, I have outgrown most of my allergies but not all. On a more positive note, somethings I also enjoy are, playing sports and socializing with friends.</p>
					<p id="more" class="hidden">I am a cardiovascular technologist major. Before I go any further, Iâ€™ll just break down what that is. What I would do as a Cardiovascular Tech is preform procedures, as in put in stents or pacemakers. I would also check on patients with heart problems, and help doctors preform tests on patients. But I do not just want to be a technician, I also want to become a doctor. So hopefully this degree sets me apart from other common pre-med majors. The reason that I came to USC is not only because of my major, but also because of its campus life, and I can now say that it was a great choice.</p>

					<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
